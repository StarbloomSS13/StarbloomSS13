/* Access is broken down by department, department special functions/rooms, and departmental roles
	The first access for the department will always be its general access function
	Access for departmental roles will start with the head and go down in level of succession
	If we ever get to a point where we have more departmental roles than the five (four) available slots, we should be looking to make some job access more generic
	Access goes from Command, Security, Engineering, Medical, Supply, Science, Service, Away Missions, Mech Access, Admin, then Antag
	Please try to make the strings for any new accesses as close to the name of the define as possible
	If you are going to add an access to the list, make sure to also add it to its respective region further below
	If you're varediting on the map, it uses the string. If you're editing the object directly, use the define name*/
